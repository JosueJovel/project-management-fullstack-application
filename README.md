Project Management Software
===============================
# Overview

A Full Stack Application for managing teams, users, and projects for companies. Admins may log in, post announcements, create new teams, assign/edit projects, and add new users for a company. Non-admins can view content but cannot make any direct changes for a company.

Angular is used for the front end framework, and Spring Boot is used for the REST API. PostgreSQL is used for the database. This project was completed as a group effort with other developers in the FastTrack'd program provided by Cook Systems.
