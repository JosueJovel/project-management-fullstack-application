# Business Requirements

---

Cook Systems would like this development team to develop a wiki style application for tracking on-boarding information for FT graduates joining new companies. Regular users of this application represent graduates placed at a client. 

A regular user should be able to login and see any announcements posted by a FT admin for graduates placed at their respective client (FedEx grads should see FedEx announcement, LQK grads should see LQK announcements, etc.). They should also be able to access and edit the documentation for the projects of the teams they're on at their respective company. This would allow graduates already placed to document any helpful on-boarding processes that were not provided by the client, give tips and tricks, and even post links to useful learning resources to the new hires joining them. 

An admin user represents an internal Cook employee and serves as a moderator role. We would also be able to edit any content posted for all teams of all companies. We would like to be able to post announcements to all FastTrack grads placed at a specific company. For now there is no need to have an overall announcements page that anyone can access. Announcements should only be visible to users of the company the announcement is posted on. We would also need the ability to manage users (add, remove, and track who has actually accepted our request to join). Lastly, we need the ability to create and manage teams for each company.

We've provided you with a basic skeleton and a wireframe for the frontend. Please reach out to us if you have any questions on the functionality of the website.
